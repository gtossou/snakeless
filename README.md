### Summary

Fourth app done in my roadmap to become a fullstack web developper.
It's the popular snake game. A game we almost all played younger and still today. 
Here, you can tune the difficulty level from Easy to Insane  and compete to beat the record(coming soon).

The game engine is coded in Vanilla javascript. Front end and styling are done with **Bootstrap** and **CSS grid** 

Building a simple game always looked daunting for me. But as i learned the basics of canvas, coding the game was finally smooth.
This was a very good exercise for me to work on writing a concise code by using functions. I also used the debugger a lot to understand many bugs i encountered when building the app.

Have fun playing the game !
