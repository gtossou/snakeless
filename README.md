### Summary

Third app done in my roadmap to become a fullstack web developper.
This is a simple calculator with basic operators, memory and reset functions.

As you add operators in the operations zone, the result will show automatically. This calculation method doesn't use **eval()** function (which is not recommended). It works but i think the logic can be greatly improved.

If you click on **=** button, you also get the result but this time the underlying method used is **eval()**.

Also ,i've always been very bad in front end layout. This time i learned the fundamentals of **CSS Grid** and now i'm more confident in building more organized and beautiful layouts.
